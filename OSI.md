- Mac address - Media Access control Address, Physical and hardware gets to know. network adapter can be digested. Mac address unique, permanent address.
  can not be changed . Mac address 48 bit mac address divided into 6 parts. each part has 8 bit (1 byte ).

1. Application Layer 
   At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find the Application layer which is implemented by the network applications.
   These applications produce the data to be transferred over the network. This layer also serves as a window for the application services to access the 
   network and for displaying the received information to the user. 

   Example: Application â€“ Browsers, Skype Messenger, etc.
